## Thoughts:
This project was a major step in my learning journey. It was my first time creating a dynamic and interactive webpage, blending HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoyed designing the UI and learning how DOM manipulation could bring the page to life. Event listeners were a key feature, and this project solidified my understanding of them. This was an early project that I was able to show to my friends.

## Further ehancements::
* Refactor and modularize the code using object-oriented programming principles.
* Improve responsiveness for faster cursor movements.
* Make the code more intuitive and self-explanatory to not rely on comments.
